        "Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is often done through the use of access modifiers (like private, protected, or public in languages like Java or C++). This ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world, and access to it is only allowed through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, ignoring irrelevant details. It helps focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces that provide templates for concrete classes, while hiding unnecessary implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Inheritance:\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (the superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes. A subclass can extend or modify the functionality of a superclass, adding new methods or overriding existing ones.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Polymorphism:\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that is appropriate to their own types. In OOP, this is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). Polymorphism allows a single interface to be used with different types of objects, improving flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Composition (or Aggregation):\n",
        "Composition refers to the concept of building complex objects by combining simpler objects. It's the design principle that says an object can contain instances of other objects, thereby forming a \"has-a\" relationship. Unlike inheritance, which establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, composition allows for more flexible object designs and helps in avoiding the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these concepts enable the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems."

        "\"\"\" - Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python\n",
        "Method Resolution Order (MRO) refers to the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in the class hierarchy when you call it on an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "MRO is particularly important in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call a method or access an attribute, Python needs to determine which class's method or attribute to use, especially when there are multiple inheritance paths.\n",
        "Python uses a specific order (the MRO) to decide this.\n",
        "\n",
        "MRO in Python:\n",
        "Python uses an algorithm called C3 linearization (or C3 superclass linearization) to determine the MRO.\n",
        "The C3 linearization ensures that the MRO respects the class hierarchy and maintains the order of inheritance in a way that avoids ambiguity,\n",
        "particularly in the case of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "How MRO Works:\n",
        "Python starts looking for the method or attribute in the class where it is called.\n",
        "If it is not found in that class, Python will look in the base class (parent class).\n",
        "This process continues recursively up the class hierarchy (i.e., checking parent classes and their ancestors) until the method is found or all base classes are exhausted.\n",
        "In case of multiple inheritance, Python uses the MRO to determine the order of classes to check.\n",
        "C3 Linearization\n",
        "The C3 linearization algorithm provides a consistent way of determining the MRO in complex inheritance hierarchies. It ensures that:\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is always checked before its parents.\n",
        "The inheritance order is maintained across all levels of the class hierarchy.\n",
